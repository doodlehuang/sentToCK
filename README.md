# sentToCK
"How many messages will you have to send before CK replys you?" in as many languages as possible.

Question (Translated to English):

Assume that you have to pm(private message) CK(Craft Kevin, [@M1k0t0](https://github.com/M1k0t0)) about something urgent. However, he will not reply unless he has received _n_ messsages on that day, and the _n_ doubles each day.

Knowing that CK will reply ASAP on the first day, and you'll reach CK on a daily basis. How many messages will you have to send in total before CK replies you over 30 days?

原题 (Original Question):

私聊ck

你有急事私聊ck ，已知每天ck看到第*n*个消息之后，才会回复，且第二天需要第一天的两倍数量个消息才会回复

已知第一天ck看到第一个消息就回复了，如果你每天都去找ck，求30天内你一共发了多少个消息？
